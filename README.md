# Drowsiness Detection System for yawning as well as sleepy eyes ðŸ˜´ ðŸš« ðŸš—

A real-time drowsiness detection system using computer vision, OpenCV, and other relevant libraries. This system detects when a person is drowsy and alerts them to prevent accidents.

## Features



- Real-time drowsiness detection
- Alerts the user with a sound when drowsiness is detected
- Utilizes facial landmarks to detect eye closure and yawning

## How It Works

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**: Uses dlibâ€™s pre-trained shape predictor model to detect facial landmarks. The landmarks around the eyes are used to compute the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).
2. **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: The EAR is calculated based on the distances between the vertical eye landmarks and the horizontal eye landmarks. When the EAR falls below a certain threshold, it indicates that the eyes are closed.
3. **Yawning Detection**: Measures the distance between upper and lower lips to detect yawning, another indicator of drowsiness.
4. **Alert Mechanism**: When drowsiness or yawning is detected for a certain duration, the system triggers an alert sound to wake up the user.
